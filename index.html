Earth bound gives luxury in salon experience while partnering with various companies to ensure product waste is recycled and repurposed.</p>
   <p>At Earth Bound Beauty the stylists are committed to keeping up with the latest trends and techniques to keep you looking your best. With constant training in house by world renowned stylists, Earth Bound has cultivated an amazing relationship with its guests and community. Guest satisfaction isn't Earth Bounds only passion though. The salon team works to <b>lower the pollution</b> that average salons produce by implementing recyclable hair color and packaging.</p>
   <p>We work in tandem with <span class="highlight">Green Circle Salons</span>, who help us recycle <span class="highlight">up to 95% of the hair we cut, foils we use, and unused color</span>. They partner with recycling facilities, chemical waste facilities, and plastic producers to make this mission possible.

   <p>The products that are used by stylists and can be bought to use at home are designed to be <b>refillable</b>. Products like shampoo and conditioner come in recyclable containers for easy refilling at home. You can also bring empty product bottles and get them filled by your stylist. It is the teams' mission at Earth Bound Beauty to make <i>beauty simple for you and safe for the planet.</i></p>
   <p>At Earth bound we use an array of cruelty free product brands like Pureology and Olaplex. These brands offer many lines built for all hair types from fine and straight to thick, curly hair. We also use strictly <b><span class="important">sulfate free</span></b> brands, designed specifically to protect color-treated hair. We are always looking to use the best and most ethical products at Earth Bound Beauty.</p>
